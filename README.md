## Overview of Project
This Tableau story can be seen at this [link](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/robelio.medina.vasquez/viz/Module14Challenge_16434984085040/Overview?publish=yes)

### Purpose

The purpose of this project is to get a better understanding of bike-share data. This data is sourced from CitiBike and is based in New York City. Investors are interested in a new bike-share program and this presentation will give an in-depth view of the data.

## Results

### Top Starting Locations

![Top Starting Locations](https://github.com/Robeliom15/bikesharing/blob/main/images/Top%20Starting%20Locations.png?raw=true)

Looking at the map shows that the touristy areas of New York City have most of the traffic while the local areas have much less. Additionally, this data is during the summer when the tourist season is at its peak. The map reflects this since most will prefer alternatives to a car in the busier parts and will seek an alternative. 

### Checkout Times for Users

The chart shows the most rides are less than 30 minutes and start to drop nearing the hour mark. This means that most will not use the bike for longer than 30 minutes. 

### Checkout Times by Gender

Looking at the chart by gender will show is that both male and female riders have less than 30 minutes of use, but males have a higher rate of usage.

### Trips by Weekday Per Hour

![Trips by Weekday Per Hour](https://github.com/Robeliom15/bikesharing/blob/main/images/Trips%20by%20Weekday%20Per%20Hour.png?raw=true)

The heatmap shows high usage during the weekday commute in the morning and the afternoon. One interesting to note is Wednesday afternoon has less usage compared to the rest of the week.

### Trips by Gender (Weekday Per Hour)

![Trips by Gender (Weekday Per Hour)](https://github.com/Robeliom15/bikesharing/blob/main/images/Trips%20by%20Gender%20(Weekday%20Per%20Hour).png?raw=true)

As the last chart, it shows that there is high usage for the weekday commute in the morning and the afternoon. This chart shows greater usage for male riders compared to female riders. Interestingly we can still see the anomaly during the afternoon on Wednesday.

### User Trips By Gender by Weekend

This chart amplifies the message that mostly male riders dominate the rider base. Male riders also have a high percentage of the subscriber base. 

### Bike Repairs

This chart shows that bikes that have a high usage of use will need more frequent repairs. This is not the case for bikes that have much less usage. Bikes that have high usage will need to be monitored more closely to prevent any accidents.

## Summary

The program shows to have success in the many tourist areas in New York City. A large percentage of the service are mainly used by the tourist population. There is high usage during the morning and afternoon weekday commute. Additionally, the service has a large male userbase which opens an opportunity to expand to female riders.  

There is still more information that can be explored such as:
- More detailed charts that will show why females do not use the service as much as male riders. 
- Trip duration by gender and age will help give a better picture.
